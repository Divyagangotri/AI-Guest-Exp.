# AI-Powered Guest Experience Personalization System for Hospitality

# Introduction

This project improves hotel guest experiences using AI. It understands guest feedback, detects their mood, and gives personalized suggestions using powerful language models like OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA. It also alerts staff if something needs immediate attention.

## Model Overview

The system has four main parts:

- Sentiment Analysis – Understands if guest feedback is positive or negative.

- Recommendation System – Suggests personalized activities or services.

- Guest Profile Management – Updates guest preferences in real time.

- Notification System – Alerts hotel staff when needed.

### Implementation

To begin with, guest feedback is collected from various sources such as CRM data, review forms, or surveys, and is converted into structured data. This data is then processed using large language models like OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA, which help in understanding the sentiment of the feedback and generating suitable suggestions. The processed insights are displayed through a web-based application built using Streamlit, offering hotel staff a clear and interactive view of guest preferences and moods. If the system detects any negative sentiment or potential issues, it sends real-time alerts to the concerned staff through email or internal communication tools, enabling them to take immediate action and improve the guest experience.

#### Evaluation

##### Conclusion

This AI project helps hotels offer better service by understanding each guest's needs and responding quickly. It creates a more personalized and satisfying experience for every guest.
